The ImageMod project is designed to showcase the Go language's strength in both systems-level and high-level programming tasks, such as image manipulation. The project integrates a third-party package for graphics manipulation (github.com/fogleman/gg). The core feature of the project is an ImageManipulator class, which enables users to perform rudimentary image operations like drawing a rectangle on an existing image. Users can easily initialize an image manipulation instance and perform a variety of operations on images.
