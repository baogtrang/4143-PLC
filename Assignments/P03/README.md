## P03 - Image Ascii Art
### Bao Trang
### Description:
The Image Ascii Art project is an extension of the Go language's capabilities in image manipulation. Integrating both Go's standard libraries and third-party packages such as `github.com/fogleman/gg`, the project's focal point is image manipulation and the creation of colored text images. The modular design of the project allows users to download images, convert them to grayscale, and render colored text onto images, demonstrating Go's versatility in both low-level and high-level tasks.
